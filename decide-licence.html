        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The DECIDE Tool is a website for sharing information about where to go to record wildlife.

        <h2 id="privacynotice">Privacy Notice</h2>
        <h3>1. Who we are </h3>  
        <p>
            UKCEH is an independent, not-for profit research institute and is a registered Charity 
            in England & Wales (number 1185618) and in Scotland (number SC049849), and a 
            registered Company Limited by Guarantee in England & Wales (number 11314957). 
        </p>
        <p>
            UKCEH is the controller for all processing of personal data for the purposes of 
            the DECIDE Tool. The main UKCEH Privacy Notice is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ceh.ac.uk/privacy-notice">here</a>. 
        </p>
        <h3>2. Why are we collecting your information? </h3>
        <p>
            UKCEH collects your consented personal data (if registered) in order to run 
            the DECIDE Tool and to communicate with you. When you contact us or 
            complete an online form, we will retain the personal data you provide.  
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>
            A. Without Registering 
        </h3>
        <p>
            When you use the DECIDE Tool, UKCEH collects information automatically 
            about visits to the site using Google Analytics and in our server logs. 
            This does not include any personal data but does include:  
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your IP address 
            </li>
            <li>
                The pages you request, when you request them, and how you interact with them  
            </li>
            <li>
                The type of device and browser you use 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We use this information to support our work in various ways including 
            monitoring performance, improving design, protecting against malicious 
            behaviour and supporting funding applications.  
        </p>
        <h3>B. Registering</h3>
        <p>
            The personal data about you that we may collect include:  
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Name
            </li>
            <li>
                Email address
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In data protection terms we are using the ‘lawful basis’ of ‘consent’ 
            for collecting, processing and sharing your personal data.  
        </p>
        <p>
            UKCEH is collecting your personal data in order to administer, 
            run and evaluate the DECIDE Tool. If you consent, you 
            allow the project team further permission to use your 
            contributions, such as responses to suggestions about where to 
            make wildlife records. This will further the goal of supporting 
            recorders in making wildlife records for use in monitoring 
            and research, as it is developed through feedback from users 
            and analysis of people’s use of the Tool.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Registered users are a key component of the co-design process 
            of the DECIDE Tool. Therefore we will send registered
            users occasional emails to keep them up-to-date with the project, 
            inform them of updates to the DECIDE Tool and to ask for feedback 
            on specific questions. Users can opt out of these emails at 
            anytime by emailing decide@ceh.ac.uk.  
        </p>
        <p>
            We also ask that you give us consent to relate your use of 
            the Tool to publicly-available records that you have made 
            in the past or will make via the wildlife recording platforms 
            iRecord and iSpot. Granting us consent to make this association 
            is optional and can be withdrawn at any point, up to the point 
            of publication of analysis, by 
            emailing <a target="_blank" href="mailto:decide@ceh.ac.uk">decide@ceh.ac.uk</a>.   
        </p>
        <p>
            Analysis will be used to evaluate the Tool and its use; all personal data
            will be anonymised prior to being shared with members of the 
            Project Team outside of UKCEH.
        </p>

            and the basis on which we process any personal data we collect from you, 
            or that you provide to us, is covered by the UKCEH privacy notice.
