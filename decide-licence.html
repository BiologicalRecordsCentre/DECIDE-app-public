<p>
    I consent to my information about the use of the Tool being used by researchers in 
    the DECIDE project to evaluate and improve the outputs of the project, 
    and to assess the process of co-development of the Tool.</p>
<p>Information collected can include specific ways in which you interact with the Tool, 
    responses to recommendations made through the Tool and other interventions 
    included during the co-development of the Tool. All results will be anonymised 
    so that users are not individually identifiable. Anonymised comments 
    (i.e., without personal or identifying information) may be used in publicly 
    available documents including scientific papers. All your data will be kept 
    confidentially, and access will be restricted to the evaluation team. 
    Anonymised comments may be used in scientific publications from the DECIDE 
    project team to assess the process of evaluation of this tool by volunteers. 
    Parts of this study requiring ethical approval have had this granted by 
    The University of York Environment Department Research Ethics Committee.</p>
